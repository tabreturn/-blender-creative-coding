# Creative Coding with Blender

*A collection of Blender creative coding experiments*

So, Processing has [Python Mode](https://tabreturn.github.io/#processing-reverse), which is a fantastic entry point into the world of creative coding. You won't outgrow Processing, but you might have the urge to delve into some more advanced 3D stuff---metaballs, particle systems, rigid-body/fluid/cloth dynamics, volumetrics, and so forth. The popular open-source 3D graphics package, Blender, offers all that with a Python scripting interface.

Sound exciting? You can [get started now](https://tabreturn.github.io/#blender-reverse).
